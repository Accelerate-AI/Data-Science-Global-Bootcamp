# Assignment 11 - Model deployment 

We are interested in deploying a model to predict the mileage of cars.
400 cars were measured and its data is available in the file Car_mileage_data.csv.

1) Train a decision tree and identify the top 4 features that impact the mileage of cars.
2) Save the trained model as a pickle file
3) Deploy the saved model on GCP and share the link to predict mileage of car

The starter code and required files are available in the folder car-mileage.
