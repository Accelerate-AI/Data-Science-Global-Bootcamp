    "We typically encounter bitstrings when we perform one-hot encoding on categorical columns of data. For example, in a data center energy optimization analysis, we have a feature named ```Chiller_Temp``` which can hold values such as Hot, Cold, Very Hot, Warm etc. If we represent in binary strings, then:\n",
