SciPy is a collection of mathematical algorithms and convenience functions built on the NumPy extension of Python. It adds significant power to the interactive Python session by providing the user with high-level commands and classes for manipulating and visualizing data.

SciPy is organized into subpackages covering different scientific computing domains. These are summarized in the following table:

Subpackage
- cluster :  Clustering algorithms
- constants : Physical and mathematical constants
- fftpack : Fast Fourier Transform routines
- integrate: Integration and ordinary differential equation solvers
- interpolate: Interpolation and smoothing splines
- io : Input and Output
- linalg: Linear algebra
- ndimage: N-dimensional image processing
- odr: Orthogonal distance regression
- optimize: Optimization and root-finding routines
- signal: Signal processing
- sparse: Sparse matrices and associated routines
- spatial: Spatial data structures and algorithms
- special: Special functions
- stats: Statistical distributions and functions

SciPy sub-packages need to be imported separately, for example:
 **from scipy import linalg, optimize **
